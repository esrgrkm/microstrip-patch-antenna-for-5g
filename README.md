# microstrip-patch-antenna-for-5g
 Antennas are used to capture electromagnetic waves that are traveling through
 space and either offer propagation within the transmission channel or emit electromagnetic
 waves into space. In terms of the waves they emit, antennas can transmit data many
 kilometers distant. Antennas are one of the most critical components of contemporary
 telecommunications systems.
 Developments in wireless communication systems increase the need for antennas
 day by day. In line with this need, antenna technologies are in the process of continuous
 development and improvement. Designs that take up less space and have more range are
 being studied. Microstrip antennas come to the fore with their small size and lightweight, thin
 structure, not disrupting the structures to be used, low power consumption, linear (vertical or
 horizontal) and circular polarization, being able to be used in dual frequency applications,
 and using patches in various geometric shapes.
 My goal is to design a broadband microstrip patch antenna for 5G communication.
 5G needs spectrum across low, mid and high spectrum bands to deliver widespread
 coverage and support a wide range of use cases. All three ranges have important roles to
 play. My antenna will work in the mid band spectrum. Mid-bands typically offer a good
 mixture of coverage and capacity benefits. The majority of commercial 5G networks are
 relying on spectrum within the 3.3-3.8 GHz range. More spectrum will be needed to maintain
 5G quality of service and meet growing demand in the longer term (e.g. 3.3-4.2 GHz, 4.8
 GHz and 6 GHz).
